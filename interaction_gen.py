# Kobold Fight Club already offers a pretty useful encounter generator, but what would be useful would be one that
# also pulls in random factors to make encounters/interactions more interesting. If one could specify based on
# climate (snow, desert, naval, etc.), urban vs. rural, coast or highlands, and have their encounters include ways to
# make encounters interesting. Some examples might be that the encounter with 3 dire wolves involves a wooden rope
# bridge under threat of breaking to a 100 ft. fall, some cliffs, and maybe thunderstorm threatening to strike.

# This is normally the DMs job to make encounters more interesting than just throwing sacks of HP at the party,
# but having a generator that you can specify some factors to help come up with ideas would be awesome.
