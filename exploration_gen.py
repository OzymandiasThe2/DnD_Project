# Exploration encounters encompass any instance in which the players investigate, explore, or problem solve. Examples
# include researching the defenses and patrol schedules of an enemy camp, discovering a treasure hoard in the ruins
# of an ancient city, or solving the riddle to unlock the door to an ancient temple. If a player is discovering or
# learning something new, it is an exploration encounter.
